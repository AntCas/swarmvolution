Will a group of neural-nets with aligned interests evolve cooperative behavior?

# DONE:
* game world
* naive predator and prey organisms
* predators eat prey
* print stats, argparse

# TODO:
* Make more parameters and hyperparameters accesible from command line
* Implement fitness functions for prey and predators
* Add control via neural-net
* Implement genetic algorithm
* pickle neural-nets/universe for later use
