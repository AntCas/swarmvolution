# swarmvolution
Will a group of neural-nets with aligned interests evolve cooperative behavior?

# DONE:
* game world
* naive predator and prey organisms
* predators eat prey
* print stats, argparse
* Implement organism vision
* have one iteration pass to detect all organism collision (instead of 4)
* move behavior decisions into the organism classes
* add organism type (PREY, PREDATOR) to organism class attributes

# TODO:
* fix stats summary (double counting things currently)

# TODO:
* Implement fitness functions for prey and predators
* Make more parameters and hyperparameters accesible from command line
* Add control via neural-net
* Implement genetic algorithm
* pickle neural-nets/universe for later use
